It looks like you've provided code for functions that perform addition and multiplication of unlimited numbers using the ...numbers rest parameter. You also want to create a README file. Here's how you can create a README file for your GitHub repository:

Create a README.md File:

In your project directory, create a new file and name it README.md. The .md extension stands for Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language for formatting text.
Edit the README File:

Open the README.md file using a text editor or an integrated markdown editor (if available in your code editor).
Write your project's documentation, description, usage instructions, and any other information you want to provide.
Here's a basic example of what you could include in your README.md file:


# Math Functions

This repository contains simple JavaScript functions for adding and multiplying numbers.

## Add Numbers Function

The `addNumbers` function takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.

Example usage:

```javascript
const result = addNumbers(2, 6);
console.log(result); // Output: 8

Multiply Numbers Function
The mulNumbers function takes any number of arguments and returns their product.

Example usage:

const result2 = mulNumbers(2, 6);
console.log(result2); // Output: 12
Feel free to add more details, explanations, or any additional information you want to provide.


3. **Save and Commit the README File:**
   - Save the `README.md` file.
   - Use the Git commands to commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file"
     git push origin main
     ```

   Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you're using a different branch.

After following these steps, your repository will have a `README.md` file that explains the purpose and usage of your functions. Users visiting your repository will be able to read the README file to understand how to use your code.
